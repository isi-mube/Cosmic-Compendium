## About the Project
<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective of this <strong>project</strong> is to do binary image classification with galaxies, either spiral galaxies or non-spiral. The images are provided from the <strong>Galaxy Zoo 2 project</strong>, a Hubble Space Telescope open-source dataset.
</p>

## About the Hubble sequence
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <strong>Hubble sequence</strong> is a morphological classification for galaxies, published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble"><strong>Edwin Hubble</strong></a> in 1926, dividing regular galaxies into three main classes; ellipticals, lenticulars, and <strong>spirals</strong>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Spiral galaxies, which are abundant in the universe, display a distinctive disk with spiraling arms and a gas and dust-rich central bulge. Studying spiral galaxies gives us a peek into the universe's past and helps us understand galaxy evolution and cosmology.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <strong>Galaxy Zoo</strong> involved human volunteers for visual and pattern recognition through a decision-tree process, answering questions progressively about a galaxy's structure.

## Project development:

* 01/06/23: Data collection and defining the problem; image binary classification to detect either spiral galaxy or not.
* 15/06/23: The script is nearly done.
  * Reduced the number of images used for the model training and testing to a subset of 1000. 
* 15/06/23 to 21/06/23: Fixing errors and cleaning the code.
* 29/06/23:
  * Further cleaning of the code and bugs.
  * Got an 81% accuracy predicting unseen galaxies. Total number of epochs: 35.
  * Removed some data directories from GitHub for optimization.
* 06/07/23: Finally got `val_accuracy` running (and not frozen) adapting [Sabina's](https://github.com/sabinagio) CNN structure in [Glaucoma detection](https://github.com/sabinagio/do-you-see-what-AI-see), need to upgrade it further to get better scoring. Also:
  * 1.400 unique galaxies for the training subset and 600 unique galaxies for the validation subset.
  * Changed adam optimizer to adamax.
  * Added ImageDateGenerator parameters; horizontal flips, width and height shifts and zoom range to 0.3.
  * Augmented image size to 256x256 to get better resolution.

## Further project development:

* Include metrics visualization for comprehensive understanding.
* Increase the number of epochs to improve accuracy.
* Further cleaning the code for readability.
* Develop a Streamlit app for more interactive model visualization.
* Take a break, keep focusing on Python basics, and move on to image segmentation and multiclassification.
